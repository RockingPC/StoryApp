    <h5>1. BOY MEETS FROG 
     I was sitting in class the first time that I saw the frog.
     
     Miss Weaver had been my teacher for a few months, and was best known around Stagwood for having a stack of black hair that rose a foot above her head. Before the school year started, I’d heard rumors about her, and within a week I realized that they were all true. For one thing, she did, in fact, wear the same outfit every day; the colors changed, but she always had on striped pants and a striped jacket. For another thing, she was mind-numbingly boring. The kind of boring that makes your eyes shut without your permission. The biggest problem, though, was the stories. She was obsessed with tales of former students who had become some kind of famous. The first couple of times weren’t bad, maybe even kind of interesting, but by the second week of school she had started repeating herself, just like her outfits. 
     
     By then, I knew all the stories by heart. The professional football player who was good at math. The politician who was a teacher’s pet. I knew every word. Instead of trying my hardest to listen, I spent most of class drawing in my notebook. Most classes, I drew imaginary places and then whipped up some creatures to fill them. They had horns where horns don’t go, fur where scales should be, and all the wings. They were odd, and they each had a story that I wanted to tell. But, on that day, I never even got to the first pair of wings. I had barely gotten started when the frog appeared and changed my life forever.
     
     It was a moment of exceptional boredom when I saw it. Its little green face was pressed up against the window nearest to me. My pencil stopped dead in its stubby tracks. I couldn’t stop 	looking at the frog and it couldn’t stop looking back. We were locked in a staring contest with unknown stakes. Maybe some frogs blinked, but with its eyes smushed against the glass, this one didn’t. Stagwood Forest was just beyond the schoolyard and it was riddled with frogs, but they always avoided people. I knew right away, in a way that I could think better than I could say, that this frog was different.
     
     I tried to listen back in to Miss Weaver, just in time to hear the end of her story about Martin Shandals, the now-famous comedian. Martin had transferred schools half way through the year, so I always felt to me like that one shouldn’t count. We were supposed to be learning long division, but something had reminded her of Martin. I knew exactly what bad joke she would end the story with, and much less about long division. 
     
     “Whenever he acted up in class I’d say, ‘we’ve got a real comedian on our hands don’t we?’ And I was right!” she said with a giggle. 
     
     I was sure that Miss Weaver would see the frog eventually, but I was wrong. Nobody did. When I looked again to see if it was still there, I noticed something shiny. It made me forget all about class, and Miss Weaver and Martin Shandals. There was no denying it: this frog had put on a tiny pair of glasses. 
     
     I wanted to lecture it, to explain that frogs don’t wear glasses. 
     
     It bothered me that it didn’t already know that. 
     <br>
     <br>
     <h5>On top of that, it had been staring at me for at least five minutes. It seemed to be bordering on rude. Could a frog even be rude? I wasn’t sure. But, the bigger question was why it was so interested in me.
     
     I wasn't the type of kid who got attention. Teachers always wrote “needs to participate more” on my report cards (with a smiley face to make my parents feel better). I never got into trouble and barely ever stood out on purpose. A few years earlier, I accidentally peed my pants because my zipper had gotten stuck in the bathroom at the last moment. I tried to convince everyone that I had fallen into a puddle at recess. The custodian, Mr. Salazar, charged outside with a mop and brought me with him to point out the puddle. My guess is that we wasted a half-hour looking around at the dry gravel. Luckily, my mom dropped off some new clothes and nobody really noticed my wardrobe change (…or that it hadn’t rained in weeks). 
     
     That’s how it was. 
     <br>
     <h5>
     Whether I did something spectacular or sneezed myself out of a chair, nobody cared, and almost nobody said my name. As far as school was concerned, all those things had happened to “some kid”. So, why would a frog with glasses jump up on a windowsill to stare at "some kid"? 
     
     Teachers, on the other hand, were a different story. Once her lesson started back up, it didn’t take Miss Weaver long to realize that I wasn’t paying attention. She called me up to the blackboard to make an example out of me. 
     
     “Since you don’t feel the need to listen, why don’t you solve a problem on the board instead?” she said, sitting down at her desk. 
     
     My stomach immediately did a flip. Then it did a flop. The problem would take a minute or two to solve, and being in front of the class always made me nervous. How could I be expected to do anything when there was a spectacled frog staring me down?
     
     I walked to the right of the equation on the board so that I could check on the frog with a glance. Despite the distraction, I did my best to focus. Halfway through, I saw that the frog had moved towards the front of the classroom. It stopped at the window by Miss Weaver’s desk. It took me a moment to figure out what it was doing. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It was trying to lift the window!
     
     Finishing the problem became almost impossible. I made a mistake and then quickly erased it. The next time I looked over, the window was open. Why should that surprise me? Of course a frog with glasses would also be super strong. The window was only open an inch, but that was enough for it to slip through. I dropped the chalk, and some of my classmates laughed. Bending down to pick it up, I tried convincing myself that when I stood back up again the frog would be gone. “It’s not there. I just think it’s there.”
     
     When I straightened up, the frog was sitting on Miss Weaver’s left shoulder. 
     
     This was a brave frog. 
     
     Her head blocked the class from seeing it, and I realized that I was still the only one who could. Either the frog was real or my imagination had outdone itself. It wasn’t all that surprising that Miss Weaver didn’t feel it there, because the shoulder pads inside her jacket were large and fluffy. I had heard that she rested her head on them like pillows during her breaks. There was a frog sitting on Miss Weaver’s shoulder and nobody else knew it. And I was supposed to be doing math.
     
     Now that it was closer, I could see the frog better. It didn’t look like some new species of frog to me. It looked like every other frog I had seen (except for the glasses). I wondered if they made contacts small enough for a frog. But, it wasn’t the right time to worry about frog vision. That would be a job for a frog eye doctor, anyway.
     
     I had daydreams all the time when I was drawing, and sometimes I got lost in them. It was possible, I thought, that my imagination had just carried me away. I tried one last time to explain the frog away as part of an elaborate daydream. I concentrated hard, finished the problem, and put the chalk down. The frog couldn’t be real. I shook my head confidently. 
     
     When I turned to Miss Weaver, I saw the frog look me square in the eyes and nod. A moment later, it disappeared into Miss Weaver’s hair.</h5> </h5>

<h2>The Story of Yes and No</h2>

<br>
<h5> Before words were words, a boy named Yes lived in a small village in a small kingdom. Yes was good at everything. He was the best, smartest and most liked person in his village. 

     Yes had a brother, and his name was No. No was jealous of his brother, because he was not much good at anything himself. Whenever the villagers asked No for help, he 
     
     refused because he didn’t like people very much.  Whenever someone asked Yes for a favor, he would gladly help, and he secretly didn’t mind the fact that it irritated No when he did.
     
     
     One day Yes and No’s father, Okay went on a long journey and he left his two sons in charge of all the animals. Yes took good care of the great guck, and the icks, and the three-toed yock. [Keep in mind, my dear friend, that the guck, ick, and three-toed yock were very old animals, so you might know them by different names today.] No didn’t want to be bothered with the boring tasks involved with taking care of the animals. So instead of helping his brother, No went down to the lake and threw rocks into the water. 
     
     <br>
     <br>
     
     
     
     A few days after his father left, Yes asked his brother to watch the three-toed yock while he went to find some food to eat. Instead of doing what Yes asked, No lay down, shut his eyes, and forgot about the yock.
     
     
     It just so happened that the King had a personal road nearby, and he traveled on it often.  So often, that when the three-toed yock wandered onto the road, the King’s carriage was passing by and had to swerve to avoid hitting it.  The King was thrown from the carriage and fell to the ground and hurt himself.
     
     The King demanded to know why a three-toed yock had been allowed on his road and asked all the villagers for an explanation. Yes was always honest, so he told the King the entire story.
     
     The King thought for a moment, and then he came up with an idea that he was quite happy with. Yes and No were to work in the castle as his personal assistants as punishment for what was later referred to as the worst three-toed yock and carriage accident in the Kingdom’s history.
     

     The King needed help with many things around the castle because a King cannot be bothered with the daily tasks involved with running a Kingdom.  However, soon after his decision about the two brothers, the King realized that only Yes would be of any use to him as a servant.  Whenever the King asked No to bring him anything, it would get thrown away, broken, or eaten, without exception. The King was quite sure that No was the worst servant in the entire world. 
     
     
     The brothers’ most important task was to help pick the food for a grand party that the King was throwing later that night. Cooks from all over the Kingdom lined up at the castle’s gate to offer the King their food for the party.  Of course, the King could not go and grab the food himself, so he asked Yes and No to do it for him.
     
     The first cook came up the gate and yelled to the Gatekeeper, “I bring my delicious ugberry pie for the King’s banquet!”  The King heard this and thought that ugberry pie would be perfect for such an event (and he would love to eat the leftovers). He didn’t want anything to happen to the ugberry pie, so he yelled “Yes!” and then asked him to go fetch it.
     
     
     The next cook stepped up to the gate. “I offer the King grukie soup!” he said.
     
     The King didn’t like grukie soup very much and he knew just how to get rid of it.
     
     “No!” he yelled and then sent No out to retrieve the soup. No dropped the soup before the King could even smell it.
     
     
     This went on for hours. If the king liked a dish, he would yell “Yes!” and it would be included in the night’s feast. If he did not, everyone would hear a loud “NO!” and the dish would be destroyed moments later by a servant with a very bad attitude.
     
     Pretty soon this started catching on around the Kingdom, for if a King does something, his loyal subjects are never far behind.  If they didn’t want a second scoop of potatoes, they would say “No.” And if they liked what someone was offering, they would say, “Yes.” And ever since that day in a small village in a small kingdom, Yes has meant Yes, and No has meant No. 
     
     <br>
     This small kingdom also happens to be the birthplace of Yes and No’s cousins, Please and Thanks, but that is another story for another time…</h5>

<br>
<h5>Long ago, there was a rock floating through space, searching for where she belonged. She would visit many planets and travel to the farthest reaches of the universe, but would she find what she was looking for? The Stellar One is a tale of self-esteem and self-discovery.
     <br>
     When the universe was young the sky was filled with planets, and stars, and stardust, and many many rocks. 

     One of these rocks was a bit more special than the rest.  She was unlike any that came before her. 
     
     
     She was a kind and happy rock, who always floated near a big blue planet. 
     
     Sometimes when the light hit her surface, she would glow a brilliant green.  At times like those, she almost didn't look like a rock at all. 
     
     
     As the sky moved from day to day, and week to week, the rock would see planets far off in the distance. 
     
     She would wonder what it would be like to go to them. Week after week and month after month she would wonder. Until one day she decided to go find out. 
     
     
     The rock had never gone anywhere before and wasn't sure how to go about it. 
     
     She started to rock back and forth.
     
     Then she started to spin. 
     
     Soon enough, she was flying through the sky. 
     
     As she left, clouds swirled on the big blue planet. For it was sad to see her go, and when planets cry there is a rain storm. 
     
     
     At first the rock was not good at moving. She would spin too far to the right or too far to the left. Slowly she learned how to travel whichever direction she liked, and she enjoyed exploring space. 
     
     
     She saw a planet filled with water, with not a speck of land.
     
     
     Then found a planet all dried up, with beaches made of sand.
     
     
     She swore she met a planet who looked suspiciously like her.
     
     
     And then she saw a planet that was, well… she wasn’t sure. 
     
     
     One planet she discovered, had grown forests made of green.
     
     
     Another one was very shy, not fond of being seen.
     
     
     She flew right by a planet, that was frozen icy cold.
     
     
     And then she saw a planet that was made of jewels and gold!
     
     
     She had started to notice that each planet seemed brighter than the last. 
     
     They were all so different and all so pretty. 
     
     It became hard for her to decide where to go next. If each planet she visited was more beautiful than the one before it, then how could she decide which way to go next, and how could she decide where to stay. 
     
     So she continued traveling, afraid to miss a single planet. 
     
     Eventually she came upon the big blue planet that she had once circled, but she found that is was not the same. It was shining in a way that it never had before. It was more blue than it had ever been, and certainly more beautiful. 
     
     
     This made her stop for a moment. 
     
     “I do not know where I should go next” she said out loud. “Each direction is filled with wonderful planets. And I cannot stop, knowing that the next planet will be even more beautiful if I continue on. Even my big blue planet has grown more beautiful every day in my absence.”
     
     
     
     The big blue planet overheard this. “Can you not see why I am brighter?" it asked.
     
     
     
     "You are the brightest planet I have ever seen," she said, "but I do not know why you glow brighter today than you did when I left you."
     
     
     
     “You have brightened me,” it said. 
     
     
     
     “But I am just a rock” she replied. 
     
     
     
     “You are no longer just a rock like the day you left me,” said the big blue planet. “You have grown bold and bright. Now you are a shooting star, and you are the reason that I shine.  And while you are worrying about which direction to go, all of the planets in space are hoping that you will come their way to brighten them.”
     
     
     
     And so the shooting star, who was no longer just a rock, finally understood. It did not matter where she went, the light was her own. 
     
     
     
     So the rock sat there for a moment, by the bright blue planet and wondered. 
     
     
     
      "Should I keep traveling, or should I fly around the big blue planet and grow brighter with it each day.”
     
     
     
     She thought, until she knew exactly what to do.

<h5>
     When the princess goes missing, the king asks the greatest hero in the land to save her. But what help is a hero who's afraid of butterflies? Follow this tale of a tooth-brushing dragon, a cookie-baking villain, and a misfit princess, who stumble their way to a most atrocious ending you have to read to believe. <br>
     I must warn you… this book is ATROCIOUS!



The cover has mud all over it, and one of the pages has sprung a leak.



Even some of the order are in the wrong words.



It is the worst of the worst, so don’t say I didn’t warn you…



Our story begins with an atrocious King, 



None of his laws ever made any sense.



“Tuesday?” he laughed, “There is no such day, and I’ll hear no more of it as long as I am king.”



From that day on in the kingdom, Monday was followed by second Monday or first Wednesday.



His daughter was an atrocious Princess.

She was not fancy and polite like most princesses, despite the princess lessons she took each day.

She never brushed her hair. 

She smelled of month- old bananas, and she was very devious.

She even set traps throughout this story.  [Illustrations throughout the story will indicate the Princess’ traps]



One day the Princess went missing. 

In her place there was a note that read:

“I’ve  taken the Princess.

You me catch never will.”

After reading the note twice to understand it, the King commanded the greatest hero in the land to find his daughter. 



The greatest hero in the land happened to be an atrocious hero.

He was often too frightened to leave his home, and he was also scared by butterflies.

However, he had once defeated two caterpillars and a moth in a single battle, and this made him the greatest of all the heroes in the land.



The hero rode to the castle of the meanest villain in the kingdom, but the villain, too was atrocious.

He brought flowers to old ladies whenever he could. 

And out of the kindness of his heart, he once built a house for someone who needed it. [The hero]



The hero stormed the gate and charged into the dungeon of the villain’s castle.

“Surrender the Princess!” he yelled while shaking in his armor.

“I don’t have a Princess,” said the villain, “I use this dungeon to bake cookies, but watch your step because there’s a leak down here.” [An example of a Princess trap with words floating in water.]

The hero was more confused than usual.

“If you didn’t take the Princess, then who did?” asked the hero. “We should go ask the dragon what he thinks.”



Mind you, this was an atrocious dragon. 

He was known for being tidy and wise, not fierce and ferocious like dragons are supposed to be. 

He brushed his teeth every night, and when he breathed, there was no fire, just minty freshness.



The dragon was very upset when they found him. 

“Someone’s stolen my gold, and they left this note in its place!” he cried.

It read:

“Your gold is with the Princess!

Mine now is it!”



“This is odd,” said the hero.

“Very odd,” said the villain.

“Frmph,” said the dragon who always flossed his teeth when he was upset.

“Perhaps the Queen knows something.”



The Queen was running around the castle when they arrived.

She, actually, was not so atrocious (for it was she who hired the royal scribe who wrote this very book).

“My treasures are missing” she cried. “My books and jewels, and my fine silk.”

“Someone has taken them and left this atrocious note.”

It read:

“Your treasure is mine!

Do not trying to bother find it.”



“Whoever has stolen your treasure has the Princess,” said the hero.

“Here are some flowers,” said the villain.

“Look!” said the dragon, “there are footprints of dirt on the floor.”



They followed the footprints all the way up to the tallest tower in the tallest part of the castle.

When they looked inside they found all the gold, books, jewels, and silk, covered in dirt.

And sitting on a throne on top of the pile, was the Princess.





“Why did you steal these things and make us look for you?” asked the Queen.

“I didn’t want to go to my writing lessons!” said the Princess, “Who needs writing?”

“You do,” said the Queen.  The villain, knight, and dragon all nodded in agreement.

The Queen made the Princess return what she had stolen and apologize.





From that day on, the King made the Princess go to her lessons six days a week.

She was an atrocious student when they began, but she got better each day.

It took the dragon hours to brush all the dirt off his coins.

The villain developed a taste for soggy cookies, and he baked them all the time.

The hero decided it was finally time to battle a butterfly… and he lost.

As for the Queen, she insisted that the entire atrocious tale be written inside of one of her muddy books.





I warned you this book was atrocious, and now it is over!

Perhaps, one day you could write a better one…
